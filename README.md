# ManyMelodies

A standalone JavaScript Discord music implementation.

## Reasoning

There are many JavaScript music implementations out there. Arguably, one of the best out there is the one made by [abalabahaha](https://github.com/abalabahaha) which resides in Eris. However, unless you use Eris there is currently no way to use it. This package extracts that implementation so that it can be used with other amazing JavaScript Discord libraries like [StarGear](https://github.com/DasWolke/StarGear).

## NOTICE

This is merely an extracted version of [Eris's](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) music implementation.
